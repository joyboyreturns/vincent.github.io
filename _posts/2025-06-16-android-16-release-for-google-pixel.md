Your UI gets a facelift with new theming options, midscreen widgets, and smoother animations—plus HDR screenshots that really pop.

Some Pixel 7/7 Pro users notice a slight back-swipe delay—rolling back is easy via Recovery if you hit a snag. Otherwise, the 16.1 minor update should land later in 2025 with fixes.
