macOS Tahoe (26) beta is Apple’s boldest Mac update yet: a full “Liquid Glass” redesign, next-level Spotlight, and deeper Apple Intelligence all rolled into one. For the complete list of changes straight from Apple, check out the official release notes.  

## 1. Liquid Glass & Theming  
> “Your Mac, now translucent and personal.”  
- Translucent “Liquid Glass” UI across windows, the Dock, widgets, and built-in apps  
- New theme engine: pick highlight colors, icon styles, and accent hues beyond just Light/Dark  
**Question:** Which accent color are you trying first?

## 2. Widgets on Your Desktop  
- Widgets now float freely on the desktop—goodbye, Notification Center panel  
- Fully transparent Menu Bar (with an Accessibility toggle for a filled background)  
*(Pro tip: watch how your wallpaper peeks through!)*

## 3. Spotlight Revolution  
> “Search at the speed of thought.”  
- Four quick-access tabs: Apps, Files, Shortcuts, Clipboard  
- Custom keyboard shortcuts for each tab—Raycast who?  
**Poll:** Which tab will you bind to ⌘+Space?

## 4. Continuity & Apple Intelligence  
- Deep Phone integration + Live Activities on Mac  
- System-wide AI: Live Translations in Messages, smarter Shortcuts, Genmoji & Image Playground boosts  
*(Imagine automatic meeting translations without leaving Messages.)*

## 5. Core App Refreshes  
- **Terminal:** vibrant color windows + new toolbar icons  
- **Finder & Safari:** Liquid Glass accents, speed boosts, and WebKit security hardening  

## 6. How to Install the Beta  
1. **Open** System Settings → General → Software Update  
2. **Enable** Beta Updates → Select macOS Tahoe 26 Developer Beta  
3. **Restart** when prompted and explore the new UI
