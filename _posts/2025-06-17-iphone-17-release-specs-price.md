## Design & Dynamic Island 2.0

The iPhone 17 series keeps the familiar flat-edge silhouette but refines it with slightly thinner bezels and a matte-glass back on Pro models. **Dynamic Island 2.0** supports interactive widgets—live weather, smart-home controls, and fitness rings—right from the lock screen without unlocking your phone.

## Camera & Computational Photography

Apple’s big camera push includes a **periscope telephoto** on the Max model, delivering up to **5× true optical zoom**. Combined with the upgraded 48 MP sensor and faster ƒ/1.6 aperture, low-light shots look cleaner than ever. New **AI Night Mode** uses machine learning to stack frames faster and reveal detail in shadows. **Cinematic Mode** now records in **4K 60 fps** with real-time subject tracking.
