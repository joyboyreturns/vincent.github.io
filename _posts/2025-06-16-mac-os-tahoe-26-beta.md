macOS Tahoe (version 26) beta delivers a sweeping visual redesign, powerful productivity enhancements, and deeper Apple Intelligence integration, all previewed at WWDC 2025. From the new Liquid Glass aesthetic and theme customization to the biggest Spotlight upgrade ever and refreshed core apps, this beta showcases Apple’s vision for the Mac’s future.

## Design Overhaul: Liquid Glass & Theming

Apple introduces the **Liquid Glass** design language throughout system UI—windows, the Dock, widgets, and built-in apps now feature a translucent, frosted-glass look that brings depth and context to your desktop.  
A new **Theming System** lets you go beyond Light and Dark: choose highlight colors, widget/icon styles, and accent hues, giving macOS a personalized flair akin to iOS 18’s appearance controls.

## Desktop Widgets & Transparency

Widgets now sit freely on the desktop by default, interacting seamlessly with your wallpaper and other content—a major shift from the dedicated Notification Center panel.  
The **Menu Bar** is fully transparent (notch-revealing on supported Macs) with an option to revert to a filled background in Accessibility settings, enhancing immersion across your workspace.

## Spotlight Revolution

Spotlight sees its **biggest update ever**, now offering four distinct quick-access categories—Apps, Files, Shortcuts, and Clipboard—plus custom keyboard shortcuts for lightning-fast searches, bringing it closer to third-party launchers like Raycast.

## Continuity & Apple Intelligence

Tahoe expands **Continuity** with deeper Phone app integration and Live Activities on the Mac, letting you manage calls, messages, and real-time updates without switching devices.  
Under the hood, **Apple Intelligence** powers system-wide features: Live Translations in Messages, enhanced Shortcuts automations, and updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, pushing Mac productivity to new heights.

## Core App Refreshes

- **Terminal gets a vibrant redesign**, introducing color-infused windows and modern toolbar icons—its first major visual update since launch.  
- **Finder and Safari** have been refined with Liquid Glass accents, plus performance improvements and security hardening from the latest WebKit updates.

## Installing the Developer Beta

The **developer beta** of macOS Tahoe is available now via the Apple Developer portal, bundled with Xcode 26 SDK for compatibility testing. To enroll your Mac in the public beta program next month:  
1. Open **System Settings → General → Software Update**.  
2. Enable **Beta Updates**, then select **macOS Tahoe 26 Developer Beta**.

## What’s Next: Public Beta & Beyond

Apple plans to launch the **public beta** of macOS Tahoe next month, with a full release expected this fall. Developers and enthusiasts alike can expect iterative refinements, additional Apple Intelligence tweaks, and further performance tuning before the final build ships.
