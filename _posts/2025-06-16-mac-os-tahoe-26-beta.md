macOS Tahoe (version 26) beta delivers a sweeping visual redesign, powerful productivity enhancements, and deeper Apple Intelligence integration, all previewed at WWDC 2025. From the new Liquid Glass aesthetic and theme customization to the biggest Spotlight upgrade ever and refreshed core apps, this beta showcases Apple’s vision for the Mac’s future  [oai_citation:0‡apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/apple/685052/apple-macos-tahoe-26-beta-hands-on-liquid-glass-themes-spotlight?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Design Overhaul: Liquid Glass & Theming

Apple introduces the **Liquid Glass** design language throughout system UI—windows, the Dock, widgets, and built-in apps now feature a translucent, frosted-glass look that brings depth and context to your desktop  [oai_citation:2‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/apple/685052/apple-macos-tahoe-26-beta-hands-on-liquid-glass-themes-spotlight?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  
A new **Theming System** lets you go beyond Light and Dark: choose highlight colors, widget/icon styles, and accent hues, giving macOS a personalized flair akin to iOS 18’s appearance controls  [oai_citation:3‡macrumors.com](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/macos-tahoes-new-theming-system-explained/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Desktop Widgets & Transparency

Widgets now sit freely on the desktop by default, interacting seamlessly with your wallpaper and other content—a major shift from the dedicated Notification Center panel  [oai_citation:4‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/apple/685052/apple-macos-tahoe-26-beta-hands-on-liquid-glass-themes-spotlight?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  
The **Menu Bar** is fully transparent (notch-revealing on supported Macs) with an option to revert to a filled background in Accessibility settings, enhancing immersion across your workspace  [oai_citation:5‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/apple/685052/apple-macos-tahoe-26-beta-hands-on-liquid-glass-themes-spotlight?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Spotlight Revolution

Spotlight sees its **biggest update ever**, now offering four distinct quick-access categories—Apps, Files, Shortcuts, and Clipboard—plus custom keyboard shortcuts for lightning-fast searches, bringing it closer to third-party launchers like Raycast  [oai_citation:6‡apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:7‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/apple/685052/apple-macos-tahoe-26-beta-hands-on-liquid-glass-themes-spotlight?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Continuity & Apple Intelligence

Tahoe expands **Continuity** with deeper Phone app integration and Live Activities on the Mac, letting you manage calls, messages, and real-time updates without switching devices  [oai_citation:8‡apple.com](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/macos-tahoe-26-makes-the-mac-more-capable-productive-and-intelligent-than-ever/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).  
Under the hood, **Apple Intelligence** powers system-wide features: Live Translations in Messages, enhanced Shortcuts automations, and updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, pushing Mac productivity to new heights  [oai_citation:9‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/news/678268/macos-version-wwdc-2025-announcement?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Core App Refreshes

- **Finder and Safari** have been refined with Liquid Glass accents, plus performance improvements and security hardening from the latest WebKit updates  [oai_citation:11‡mrmacintosh.com](https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-tahoe-26-0-beta-1-everything-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
