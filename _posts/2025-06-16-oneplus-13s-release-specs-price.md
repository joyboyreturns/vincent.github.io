# OnePlus 13 s at a Glance — Why This Mini-Flagship Matters

Seven years after the original OnePlus 6T flipped value on its head, the new **OnePlus 13 s** does the same for compact power users: think **Snapdragon 8 Elite**, a **6.32-inch LTPO 120 Hz display**, and a **6 260 mAh battery** stuffed into a pocket-friendly frame under 72 mm wide. Add a magnetic **Plus Key** that pulls up on-device AI and you have a phone built for 2025’s multitaskers, not spec sheet tourists.

## Plus Key & AI Extras

* Summon **Plus Mind** – a screenshot assistant that parses dates, addresses, and to-dos straight into Notes.  
* Fire up real-time **AI Call Translator** (English ↔ Hindi at launch).  
* Launch **Gemini** voice queries without unlocking.  
* Map any shortcut you like: camera, silent mode, payments, you name it.

## Camera & Imaging

Behind the Hasselblad badge sit two 50 MP Sony sensors:

* **Main (LYT-808, ƒ/1.6)** – 1/1.4″ sensor, OIS + EIS, 8K 24 fps or 4K 60 fps video.  
* **Telephoto (LYT-600, 2×, ƒ/2.6)** – crisp portraits and lossless zoom to 5× hybrid.  
* **Selfie (32 MP, ƒ/2.4)** – 4K 30 fps video, AI Best Face 2.0 for group shots.

Portraits finally get natural skin tones, and low-light shots lean on the new **AI Nightscape Fusion** that stacks frames from both rear sensors for extra dynamic range.

## Display, Battery & Everyday Feel

- **Display:** Flat, near-bezel-less, with 1 Hz–120 Hz adaptive refresh and 2160 Hz PWM dimming to spare your eyes.  
- **Battery life:** Two full days in mixed use; 100 W SuperVOOC charges 1 → 100 % in 26 minutes.  
- **Thermals:** A graphite-copper vapor chamber keeps temps under 42 °C while gaming.  
- **Haptics:** Upgraded X-Axis motor gives crisp vibrations for typing and Plus Key feedback.

## Early Verdict

The **OnePlus 13 s** feels like the spiritual successor to the OnePlus 7 Pro—only pocket-sized and AI-savvy. It’s not chasing Samsung Ultra territory; instead it nails the “90 % of a super-flagship for 70 % of the price” formula with delightful extras like long battery life and that addictive Plus Key. If you want a powerhouse that won’t stretch your jeans, mark 5 June on your calendar.
