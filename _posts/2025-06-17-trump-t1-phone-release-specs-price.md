## Design & Build — Gold Rush Vibes  

Forget subtle: the **Gold Edition** flaunts a matte-gold rear, bold **T1** embossing and an American-flag accent on the power key. A more understated **Patriot Black** version swaps bling for a stealth finish. At 8.9 mm thick and 210 g, the phone lands between the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Galaxy S25+.

---

## Freedom OS, 5 G & the “Unlimited Patriot Plan”  

* **Freedom OS** spices up Android 15 with red-white-blue icons, a **Caps-Lock Quick-Toggle** and built-in **“Secure Speech”** call encryption (powered by Signal code).  
* **Unlimited Patriot Plan** (U.S. only) bundles 100 GB of high-speed data, uncapped throttled data after, plus one-tap customer support that literally answers “Hello, you’re speaking to America First.”  
* Dual-SIM support means you can pop in a second nano-SIM from Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile if you’d rather not port numbers.

## Early Benchmarks & Battery Life  

Leaked Geekbench runs peg the **Snapdragon 8s Gen 3** inside the T1 at roughly **1 780 / 4 750** (single / multi), just a notch under the Galaxy S25 FE. The 20 W brick fills **0 → 50 % in 35 minutes**, with a **full top-up in 95 minutes**. Asus ROG Ally this is not, but **7+ hours of YouTube over 5 G** is respectable.
