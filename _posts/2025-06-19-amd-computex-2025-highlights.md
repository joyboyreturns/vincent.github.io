## Ryzen Threadripper 9000 Series  
AMD’s high-end desktop segment got a massive boost with the **Threadripper 9000 Series**, featuring up to 96 Zen 5 cores and support for blazing-fast DDR5-6400 memory. Built on a refined 4 nm process, these HEDT chips deliver record-breaking multi-threaded performance for content creators, VFX artists, and simulation workloads, all while offering robust PCIe 5.0 lane counts for next-gen NVMe SSDs and accelerators.

## Radeon RX 9060 XT & Radeon AI PRO R9700  
On the graphics front, AMD introduced the **Radeon RX 9060 XT**, bringing RDNA 4’s machine-learning upscaling (FSR 4) to the mainstream. With up to 16 GB GDDR6 and double the ray-tracing throughput of its predecessor, it’s poised for smooth 1440p gaming. For professionals, the **Radeon AI PRO R9700** packs 128 AI accelerators and 32 GB of GDDR6, unlocking 96 teraflops of FP16 compute and enabling local AI inference on models up to 32 billion parameters.

## AI Data-Center & Instinct Accelerators  
AMD previewed its new **Instinct MI350** series in rack-scale systems, showing off up to four MI350 cards paired with 5th-gen EPYC CPUs. These accelerators deliver competitive inference and training throughput against rival offerings—key to AMD’s push into enterprise AI deployments. A sneak peek of the **Helios** server platform, powered by upcoming MI400 GPUs, promises full-rack solutions in 2026.

## Motherboard & Storage Innovations  
Alongside processors and GPUs, AMD showcased motherboards with integrated **PCIe 5.0** M.2 slots and cutting-edge VRM designs tailored for Zen 5 power. Partners demoed Thunderbolt 4 add-in cards and ultra-dense 128 TB Gen 5 SSDs, highlighting the ecosystem’s rapid evolution.

## Rumors & Roadmap  
Whispers from Taipei hint at an **AMD Ryzen G** series refresh combining Zen 5 cores with RDNA 3 iGPUs for ultralight notebooks, plus a next-gen **Genoa-X** EPYC CPU arriving Q4 2025. Enthusiasts also expect an AMD-branded high-efficiency laptop chipset and further AI-centric firmware updates this summer.

## Upgrade Verdict  
**Who should upgrade now?**  
- **Workstation users** demanding multi-socket performance and PCIe 5.0 throughput  
- **Gamers** seeking an affordable 1440p ray-tracing boost with RX 9060 XT  
- **AI developers** wanting on-premise inference without heavy cloud costs  

**Who can wait?**  
- Budget builders eyeing sub-$300 CPUs (Zen 5 mainstream arrives later)  
- Early adopters of ultralight laptops looking for integrated Vega-class graphics  

AMD’s COMPUTEX 2025 lineup cements its leadership across gaming, creator, and AI segments—big wins for anyone ready to harness the power of Zen 5 and RDNA 4.
