**Apple’s new MacBook Air M4 keeps the fan-less silhouette but doubles the base memory to 16 GB, adds dual-monitor output, stretches battery life to a claimed 20 hours, and—surprisingly—still starts at $999, while the classic M1 Air can now be found for as little as $649 at close-out sales.**

## Specs & Design Overview  
Both models share a slim, 100 % recycled-aluminum chassis and remain completely fan-less.  
The **M4 Air** adds a new **Sky-Blue** finish and keeps the MagSafe 3 port alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.  
Dimensions and weight are nearly identical, so you won’t feel a difference in the backpack.

| Model               | CPU/GPU Cores       | Base RAM | Base SSD | Starting Price (US)      |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **M1 Air (2020)**   | 8-core CPU / 7-core GPU  | 8 GB     | 256 GB   | $649–$999 (clearance)    |
| **M4 Air (2025)**   | 10-core CPU / 10-core GPU | 16 GB    | 256 GB   | $999 (13″) / $1,199 (15″)|

## Performance Benchmarks  
- Geekbench 6: **M4** ≈ 14,900 multi-core & 3,890 single-core vs **M1** ≈ 8,350 multi-core & 2,345 single-core—about 80 % faster in multi-core.  
- Real-world exports (5 min 4K in Final Cut Pro): M4 in 4 min 12 s vs M1 in 7 min 38 s.  
- GPU: Denser 10-core design and hardware-accelerated ray tracing deliver steeper gains for graphics tasks.

## Battery Life & Efficiency  
- Apple rates the M4 Air at **up to 20 hours** of video playback.  
- M1 achieves around **11 hours 15 minutes** in the same test.  
- Mixed-use (web, coding) yields **10–12 hours** on the M4 at 75 % brightness—around 15 % better than the M1.

## Ports, Displays & Connectivity  
- **External monitors:** M4 supports **two extended displays** plus the built-in panel; M1 supports only the built-in screen.  
- Both models include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0.  
- No SD card slot or USB-A ports on either, so dongles remain necessary.

## Thermals & Noise  
Both notebooks are silent thanks to passive cooling. Under sustained CPU loads, the M1 throttles sooner and runs hotter (~12 °C higher after 20 min render) while the M4 plateaus at a lower temperature and recovers faster.

## Value & Pricing  
- **M4 Air** at $999 includes 16 GB RAM and a longer future-proof support window.  
- **M1 Air** on clearance for under $700 offers great entry-level value but is limited to 8 GB RAM and single-monitor output.  
- Resale: M1 prices will drop faster once future macOS versions favor higher-memory machines.

## Upgrade Verdict  
**Upgrade if…**  
- You need more than one external monitor.  
- You regularly edit photos or 4K video.  
- You plan to keep your laptop for 5+ years and want future-proof RAM.

**Skip the upgrade if…**  
- Your M1 handles email, browsing, and office tasks well.  
- You want to save hundreds and don’t need the extra performance.

  
The **M4 MacBook Air** represents the biggest leap in the Air lineup since Apple Silicon’s debut—eliminating the 8 GB bottleneck, enabling dual-monitor setups, and extending battery life, all at the same entry price. Heavy multitaskers and long-term users will find the upgrade well worth it; those on a budget can still enjoy solid performance from the M1.
