## 1. Sleep Takes Center Stage  
### Bedtime Guidance  
One UI 8 Watch analyzes three nights of circadian rhythm and “sleep pressure” data, then nudges you toward an optimal bedtime with on-watch reminders—ideal after late-night streaks or long-haul flights.  
### Smarter Apnea & Environment Cues  
Samsung retains last year’s FDA-cleared sleep-apnea detection and adds quick tips for light, temperature, and sound to help you lock in deeper rest.  

## 2. Heart-Health Insight: Vascular Load  
While you sleep, Galaxy Watch Ultra-class sensors now gauge fluctuations in blood-flow stress; a rising score flags lifestyle tweaks before bigger cardiovascular issues set in.  

## 3. Personal Running Coach  
Run 12 minutes and the watch rates you 1-10, then serves a calendar of 5 K-to-marathon plans with real-time pace cues and motivational audio. It launches first on **Watch 7** and up.

## 4. Nutrition Feedback: Antioxidant Index  
Place your thumb on the BioActive sensor for five seconds and the watch measures skin carotenoids—handy proof that yesterday’s carrot smoothie actually helped. It’s a Labs feature that may mature by the stable release.  

## 5. Other Notable Tweaks  
- **Wear OS 6 base** brings smoother back-gesture navigation and a battery-guardian mode capable of four-day endurance on Watch 6 Classic.  
- **New Watch Faces & Tiles** include minimalist “Starlight” and data-dense “Vitals Ring.”  
- **Power-Saving Dashboard** shows realtime drain by sensor or app, so you can silence GPS or Always-On when juice runs low.  
- **Cross-Device Continuity**: Accept a call or continue a workout summary seamlessly on a Galaxy S25 phone running One UI 8.0.
