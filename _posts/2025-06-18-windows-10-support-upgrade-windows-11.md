**Windows 10’s free support ends on October 14, 2025—leaving only paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) for three extra years—while Windows 11 keeps gaining AI-powered features and broader hardware support. Here’s what the looming deadline means, how much ESU will cost, and whether 2025 is the year to move to Windows 11.**

## 1. Windows 10 Support Timeline  

- **Mainstream support** ended in 2020; only security and reliability patches have shipped since then.  
- **Final free update**: Version 22H2 is the last Windows 10 release; no new features are planned.  
- **End of support date**: October 14, 2025, for Home and Pro editions—no more free patches via Windows Update. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

### LTSC & IoT Exceptions  
Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds continue to receive updates until 2027 (Enterprise LTSC 2021) or 2032 (IoT LTSC 2021), giving specialized devices a longer safety net. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 2. Extended Security Updates (ESU)  

| Year       | Home / Pro Price*         | Enterprise Price*      | Duration                |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 (2025–26)| ~$30 per device           | Volume-license only    | Oct 2025 → Oct 2026     |
| 2 (2026–27)| ~$122 per device          | Scales likewise        | Oct 2026 → Oct 2027     |
| 3 (2027–28)| ~$183 per device          | —                      | Oct 2027 → Oct 2028     |

\*Based on Microsoft guidance; ESU provides security fixes only, no new features. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 3. Windows 11 in 2025  

### Hardware Requirements  
- **CPU**: 8th‑gen Intel Core, 2nd‑gen AMD Ryzen, or newer  
- **TPM 2.0 & Secure Boot**: Now mandatory for built‑in security features :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

### New Features Since Launch  
- **Copilot Vision & AI Actions** in File Explorer  
- **24H2 update**: Wi‑Fi 7 support, Sudo in CLI, hibernation‑free Fast Boot on Copilot+ PCs :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

### Market Share  
Windows 10 still leads at ~53%, while Windows 11 passed 40% adoption by mid‑2025. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 4. Upgrade Pros & Cons  

| Consideration        | Windows 11                                       | Staying on Windows 10 + ESU                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**         | Free patches until ~2031 + hardware protections  | Pay for ESU; only critical fixes              |
| **Features**         | AI tools, Snap Layouts, HDR, Copilot integrated  | Stable UI; no new features                    |
| **Performance**      | Hybrid CPU optimizations, battery gains          | Consistent performance on older hardware      |
| **Hardware Cost**    | Free upgrade if PC meets requirements            | No hardware changes required                  |
| **Future‑proofing**  | 6+ years of support                              | 1–3 years of paid support                     |

## 5. Should You Upgrade?  

### Upgrade Now If…  
- Your PC is flagged “Ready for Windows 11”  
- You use cloud services, AI, gaming, or multi‑monitor setups  
- You plan to keep your PC through 2030  

### Wait or Use ESU If…  
- Your CPU lacks TPM 2.0 or is pre‑2018  
- You have legacy or business‑critical apps  
- You plan a hardware refresh by late 2026

## 6. Broader Context & Alternatives  

- Roughly **400 million PCs** may be unable to upgrade, risking e‑waste and security exposure. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **LTSC version** offers support until 2032 but is aimed at enterprise and embedded use. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Alternatives include **ChromeOS Flex** or user‑friendly **Linux distros** for repurposing older hardware. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## 7. Conclusion  
Windows 10 users have about **16 months** before free updates end. Upgrading to Windows 11 if hardware supports it avoids ESU costs, boosts security, and enables modern features. If you’re on older or unsupported hardware, ESU or alternative OSs like LTSC, ChromeOS, or Linux offer temporary reprieve—just be ready to transition by 2028.
