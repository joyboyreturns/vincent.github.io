**Windows 10’s free support ends on October 14, 2025—leaving only paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) for three extra years—while Windows 11 keeps gaining AI-powered features and broader hardware support. Here’s what the looming deadline means, how much ESU will cost, and whether 2025 is the year to move to Windows 11.**

## 1. Windows 10 Support Timeline  

- **Mainstream support** ended in 2020; only security and reliability patches have shipped since then.  
- **Final free update**: Version 22H2 is the last Windows 10 release; no new features are planned.  
- **End of support date**: October 14, 2025 for Home and Pro editions. After that, no free patches arrive through Windows Update.  

### LTSC & IoT Exceptions  
Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) builds keep patching until 2027 (Enterprise LTSC 2021) or 2032 (IoT LTSC 2021), offering niche lifelines for kiosks and medical gear.  

## 2. Extended Security Updates (ESU)  

| Year       | Home / Pro Price*         | Enterprise Price*      | Duration                |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 (2025–26)| ~$30–$61 per device       | Volume-license only    | Oct 2025 → Oct 2026     |
| 2 (2026–27)| ~$122 per device          | Scales likewise       | Oct 2026 → Oct 2027     |
| 3 (2027–28)| ~$183 per device          | —                      | Oct 2027 → Oct 2028     |

\*Based on Microsoft guidance and prior ESU pricing trends. ESU buys three more years of critical security fixes, but no new features or quality-of-life updates.

## 3. Windows 11 in 2025  

### Hardware Requirements  
- **CPU**: 8th-gen Intel Core, 2nd-gen AMD Ryzen, or newer.  
- **TPM 2.0 & Secure Boot**: Mandatory for built-in ransomware and credential-guard protection.  

### New Features Since Launch  
- **Copilot Vision & AI Actions** offer context-aware assistance directly inside File Explorer and other apps.  
- **24H2 update** adds Wi-Fi 7, Sudo in the command line, and a hibernation-free Fast Boot on Copilot+ PCs.  

### Market Share  
Windows 10 still leads at around 53%, but Windows 11 crossed the 40% mark in mid-2025 and is climbing steadily.

## 4. Upgrade Pros & Cons  

| Consideration        | Upgrade to Windows 11                     | Stay on Windows 10 + ESU             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Security**         | Free patches until at least 2031; hardware protections | Pay for ESU; limited to critical fixes |
| **Features**         | Copilot AI, Snap Layouts, HDR auto-optimisation, Dynamic Lighting | Mature, stable UI; no new features  |
| **Performance**      | Optimised scheduler for hybrid CPUs; battery gains on new laptops | Consistent performance on older gear |
| **Hardware Cost**    | Free in-place upgrade if PC meets requirements | No hardware change required         |
| **Future-proofing**  | 6+ years of support                       | 1–3 years of paid security only      |

## 5. Should You Upgrade?  

### Upgrade Now If…  
- Your PC shows “Ready for Windows 11” in Windows Update.  
- You rely on cloud services, AI tools, or multiple monitors—Windows 11 handles these better.  
- You plan to keep the same hardware through 2030.  

### Wait or Use ESU If…  
- Your CPU lacks TPM 2.0 or is pre-2018 and runs mission-critical legacy software.  
- You’re budgeting for a hardware refresh in late 2026.  
- Your organization needs time to test apps under Windows 11.

## 6. Conclusion  
Microsoft’s ticking clock gives Windows 10 users 16 months of free peace before security updates cost money. For most home users and many small businesses with compatible hardware, upgrading to Windows 11 now avoids ESU fees, unlocks modern protections, and positions you for upcoming AI-centric features. Those on older PCs can squeeze an extra year or two out of ESU, but should budget for new hardware or a move to Windows 11 before 2028.
