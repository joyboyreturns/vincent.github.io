# Meta × Oakley at a Glance — Why These Shades Matter  

For action-sports junkies and urban commuters alike, the **Meta Oakley smart glasses** aim to fuse Oakley’s iconic **Prizm™ optics** with Meta’s on-device **AI voice** and camera smarts. Think hands-free ride stats, POV clips, live translation, and subtle LED cues — all tucked inside a familiar Flak 2.0-inspired frame.

## Design — Sport DNA, Everyday Stealth  

Oakley keeps the **wrap-around curve** riders love, but thins the temples so you can slip them under a helmet strap. A soft-touch finish hides cameras nearly flush with the hinges, and a whisper-thin LED glows only when you’re recording.

---

## Meta AI on the Move  

* **Ride Coach Beta** delivers live speed, gradient, and cadence stats in your lower field of view without crowding vision.  
* **Look & Translate**: stare at trail signs or café menus and get instant overlays in English, Spanish, or French.  
* **Hands-Free Clips**: say “Hey Meta, start a 30-second video” and share straight to Reels when paired with the Meta View app.

## Battery & Connectivity  

The dual 450 mAh cells sit in each temple for balance. Expect **6 hours of mixed use** (notifications + occasional camera) and **4 hours of continuous video**. Bluetooth 5.4 keeps latency low for peloton radio chat, and Wi-Fi 6E syncs clips to your phone the moment you pop open the charge case.

## Early Verdict  

If you’ve been tempted by Ray-Ban Meta but wanted sport-grade lenses, the **Meta Oakley glasses** might be the sweet spot: better optics, longer battery, and features cyclists actually care about. The $349 base price undercuts most GoPro setups — and you won’t look like a cyborg at the coffee stop.

**Over to you:** Which feature sells you more — Prizm optics for clarity or on-device AI for hands-free footage? Sound off below!
