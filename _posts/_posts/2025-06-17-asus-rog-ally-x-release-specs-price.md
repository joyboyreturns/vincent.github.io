# Asus ROG Ally X at a Glance — Why This Handheld Matters  

Asus shook up portable PC gaming in 2023; two years later the **ROG Ally X** looks ready to do it again. Think **AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme**, **24 GB LPDDR5X RAM**, a roomy **1 TB NVMe SSD**, and an **80 Wh battery** that doubles playtime over the first-gen Ally — all wrapped in a stealth-black shell that finally feels purpose-built for marathon sessions.

## Release Date & Pricing  

- **Pre-orders:** August 2025  
- **Launch window:** Second half of October (“Holiday 2025” in Microsoft’s wording)  
- **Europe (leaked):** €899 for the Ally X (black)  
- **US (rumoured):** about **$799**  
- **Standard Ally (white):** €599 / ~$699  

Early-bird bundles are expected to toss in a three-month Game Pass Ultimate code and a carry case.

## Design, Cooling & Battery Life  

A gentle palm swell makes the Ally X easier to grip than the first model, and revised vent geometry pushes 15 % more air across the vapor chamber. Asus touts **3 hours of AAA gaming** or **11 hours streaming/indie time** on the new 80 Wh pack, and both USB-C ports can fast-charge at 65 W — so you can play while topping up or hook up an external GPU without dongles.

---

## Windows & Xbox Integration  

Because it runs full Windows 11, you get **Steam, Epic, Battle.net, GoG, Ubisoft Connect** and, of course, the **Xbox app** with **Cloud Gaming** and **Game Pass PC** titles. Microsoft’s new **“Xbox Full-Screen Experience”** boots straight into a controller-friendly dashboard the moment you power on.

## Game Library & Ecosystem  

With RDNA 4 graphics and 24 GB of shared memory, the Ally X targets **60 fps at 1080 p** in titles like *Starfield* and *Cyberpunk 2077* on Medium–High settings. Plugging into the **ROG XG Mobile** eGPU dock unleashes desktop-class frames on a 4K monitor, turning the handheld into a legit mini-gaming-rig.

## Early Verdict  

If the leaks hold, the **ROG Ally X** will cost a bit more than the Steam Deck 2 but undercut most gaming laptops with similar silicon — all while offering true Windows flexibility. Between the bigger battery, extra RAM, and dual USB-C, Asus seems to have listened to every early-adopter complaint.  

**Your move:** Are you waiting for October, or does the Steam Deck 2 still tempt you? Sound off below!
