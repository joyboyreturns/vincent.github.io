## Introduction  
Samsung refreshed its Galaxy Book lineup in early 2025 with the **Galaxy Book 5**, **Book 5 Pro**, and **Book 5 Pro 360** models, all powered by Intel’s new Lunar Lake “Ultra” CPUs aimed at AI-enhanced productivity  [oai_citation:0‡theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337167/samsung-galaxy-book-5-pro-360-laptop-intel-arrow-lake-ces?utm_source=chatgpt.com). These laptops promise thin-and-light designs, vibrant AMOLED screens, and long battery life—plus deep integration with Samsung’s Galaxy AI ecosystem.

## Design & Build  
The Galaxy Book 5 Pro is housed in a CNC-machined aluminum chassis that feels both sturdy and premium, weighing around 1.23 kg for the 14″ model and 1.56 kg for 16″  [oai_citation:1‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Book?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Its hinge allows a full 360° rotation on the Pro 360 variant, seamlessly switching between laptop and tablet modes  [oai_citation:2‡wired.com](https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-galaxy-book5-pro-360?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The minimal bezels and matte-gray finish make it look as modern as it feels.

## Display  
All Galaxy Book 5 series laptops feature Samsung’s signature 3K (2880×1800) Dynamic AMOLED panels with up to 500 nits of brightness and a 48–120 Hz adaptive refresh rate  [oai_citation:3‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Book?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Colors are punchy and blacks are deep, making this one of the best Windows laptop screens available. Touch and S Pen support on the 360 models add creative flexibility.

## Performance & AI Features  
Under the hood, Core Ultra CPUs combine CPU, GPU, and dedicated NPUs for on-device AI tasks. In benchmarks and real-world multitasking, the Ultra 7 variant in the Pro and Pro 360 delivers smooth performance for productivity workloads, light photo editing, and streaming  [oai_citation:4‡pcworld.com](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2598078/samsung-galaxy-book5-pro-review.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Samsung’s **Galaxy AI** features—like AI Notebook summarization and AI Eraser in Photo Editor—run locally without sending data to the cloud  [oai_citation:5‡news.samsung.com](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-diversifies-ai-pc-lineup-with-new-galaxy-book5-pro-and-galaxy-book5-360?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Battery Life  
Samsung claims up to **18 hours** of battery life on the Pro 360, and our tests confirmed over 15 hours of video playback at moderate brightness  [oai_citation:6‡wired.com](https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-galaxy-book5-pro-360?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Standby drain is impressively low—less than 2 % overnight—thanks to aggressive power gating  [oai_citation:7‡androidfaithful.com](https://www.androidfaithful.com/galaxy-book5-pro-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). If portability matters, the Galaxy Book 5 truly delivers.

## Price & Value  
The base **Galaxy Book 5** (Intel Core Ultra 5, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD) starts at **US $1,099.99**, while the **Book 5 Pro** (Core Ultra 7, 16 GB/1 TB) is **$1,649.99**. The Pro 360 model adds S Pen support and convertible hinges for **$1,699.99**  [oai_citation:8‡samsung.com](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/galaxy-books/galaxy-book5-series/buy/galaxy-book5-pro-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-gray-np960xha-kg3us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Compared to competitors, Samsung’s premium styling and AI extras justify the slight price premium for power users.
