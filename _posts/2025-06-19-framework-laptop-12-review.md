## Specs & Modular Design  
At the heart of the **Framework Laptop 12** is a 12.2″ 1920×1200 WUXGA touchscreen with stylus support and a 360° convertible hinge—your go-to for drawing, note-taking, or tablet-style browsing. Under the hood, you’ll find 13th Gen Intel Core U-series options (i3-1315U or i5-1334U), configurable up to 48 GB DDR4 RAM and 2 TB NVMe storage via easy-swap M.2 slots. The chassis uses a reinforced plastic exterior with a TPU bumper for extra drop protection, while the internal metal frame ensures rigidity. Five chassis colors—from classic black to Bubblegum Pink—let you personalize your modular laptop.  

## Performance & Upgradability  
With the Core i5 configuration, expect smooth multitasking and mid-range content creation, while the DIY Edition (starting at **₹47,000**/$549) offers a budget-friendly entry point. All Framework laptops share the same socketed CPU and memory modules, so you can swap in higher-speed RAM or upgrade storage without a screwdriver frenzy. Four Expansion Card slots let you swap USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, or legacy ports at will—ideal for travelers and professionals who hate dongle clutter.

## Battery Life & Display  
Framework claims up to **10 hours** of light productivity on the 45 Wh battery, with mixed-use tests (web, video, document editing) hovering around 7–8 hours at 75 % brightness. The vibrant IPS panel hits 300 nits peak brightness and covers around 100 % sRGB, making it serviceable for casual editing and streaming in bright environments.

## Ports & Expansion Cards  
- **Expansion Cards:** Four slots (two on each side) for USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD, or Ethernet modules  
- **Wireless:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2  
- **Audio:** Dual stereo speakers, M.2 NVMe-backed SSD slot beneath the keyboard  
No SD slot or legacy video out—expandability is entirely modular.

## Pricing & Configurations  
- **DIY Edition (no OS):** starts at $549／₹47,000 (i3, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)

- **Upgraded DIY:** i5 + 16 GB RAM + 1 TB SSD ≈ $749／₹64,000  
Prices climb as you add RAM, storage, or choose pre-built options, but every component is user-replaceable, extending the lifespan well beyond a typical disposable notebook.  

## Rumors & Future Upgrades  
Word in the community hints at an upcoming Linux-optimized firmware bundle, OLED panel option, and a fingerprint expansion card arriving in Q3 2025. There’s chatter about an AMD Ryzen variant by early 2026, plus color-matched MagSafe modules and a larger 14″ sibling on the horizon.

## Verdict  
**Who should buy?**  
- **Enthusiasts & students** craving a repairable, upgrade-friendly 2-in-1 under $800  
- **Professionals** who need a lightweight convertible with customizable ports  
- **Eco-minded users** prioritizing long-term value over disposable design  

**Who should wait?**

- Those wanting out-of-the-box Linux support (official build coming soon)  

The **Framework Laptop 12** stakes its claim as the most versatile budget convertible of 2025—its modular ethos may cost a bit extra up front, but the ability to swap, upgrade, and repair parts easily is a game-changer in a sea of sealed laptops.
