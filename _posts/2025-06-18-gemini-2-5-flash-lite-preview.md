## Introduction  
Google has expanded its Gemini 2.5 suite with Pro, Flash, and now the **Flash-Lite Preview**, its leanest, fastest flavor designed for high-volume applications without compromising benchmark performance. Flash-Lite brings cost savings and speed to everything from coding assistants to large-scale data pipelines.

## Key Features  
### Multimodal & Massive Context  
- **Inputs**: Supports text, image, video, and audio prompts in one unified API.  
- **Context Window**: Up to **1,000,000 tokens**, matching the capacity of Flash and Pro variants.

### Adaptive “Thinking” Budgets  
- **Default Mode**: “Thinking” disabled to maximize throughput and minimize cost.  
- **Custom Depth**: Developers can dial in more complex reasoning on demand via an API parameter.

### Native Tooling & Grounding  
- **Built-in Integrations**: Google Search grounding, code execution, function calling and URL context, making it production-ready out of the box.

### Benchmark Leadership  
- **Math & Reasoning**: Major gains on latest reasoning challenges, outpacing Gemini 2.0 in coding, science, and logic tasks.  
- **Throughput & Latency**: Sub-100 ms median response times in non-thinking mode, with up to **10×** more queries per dollar than Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## Performance & Efficiency  
- **Cost**: **$0.10 per 1 M tokens** for non-thinking calls—about one-third the cost of full Flash mode.  
- **Speed**: Optimized for real-time interfaces, chatbots, and analytics pipelines.  
- **Scalability**: Ideal for bursty workloads or sustained high-volume usage.

## Availability & Pricing  
- **Preview Access**: Live now in Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and Custom Search integrations.  
- **Billing**: Same API tiers as other Gemini models, with separate tracking for thinking vs. non-thinking usage.
